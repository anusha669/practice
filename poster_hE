Tim is a big fan of TV Series. The wall of his hostel room is full of posters of different TV Series.
Once he got curious and wanted to find out the area of the wall which is not covered by posters.
But then he found another TV Series to watch and he gave this task to you.
You are given the dimension of the wall  and  (length and height), the number of posters in his room  and the coordinates of two 
diagonally opposite corners of the posters. The posters are in the form of rectangle and they are alligned parallel to the side of the wall.
Also note that some of the posters may overlap some other posters.

5 6         // L H
3           // num of posters
0 0 2 2       // cordinates x1,y1  x2,y2
1 1 4 3
4 0 5 6

15  // area left uncovered

class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
      int L,H,t,x1,x2,y1,y2,c;
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      L = sc.nextInt();
      H = sc.nextInt();
      t = sc.nextInt();
      int a[][]  = new int[L+1][H+1];
      while(t>0)
      {
          x1 = sc.nextInt(); y1 = sc.nextInt();x2 = sc.nextInt(); y2 =sc.nextInt();
          for(int i=x1;i<x2;i++)
            for(int j=y1;j<y2;j++)
                a[i][j] = '*';
          t--;
      }
      for(int i=0;i<L;i++)
        for(int j=0;j<H;j++)
            if(a[i][j]!='*')
                t++;
     System.out.println(t);
     sc.close();
